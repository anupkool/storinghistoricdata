# storinghistoricdata

Write a program to fetch the historical prices and dates of gold and silver from these 2 URLs:
•             https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold-historical-data
•             https://www.investing.com/commodities/silver-historical-data
and store them locally (in a file or database, as you see fit).
